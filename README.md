## Purpose

This is an initial experimental repository looking at CoPilot and how to work closely with the ML tool to accelerate my develop throughout a more complex, holistic and useful product.

## Setup

### macOS / Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install flask numpy
```

## WIP

There is more to come here, I'm expecting all PRs to be raised by CoPilot based on my prompts.
